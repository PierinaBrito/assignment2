Coding Exercises
1. **While Loop**:
Write a Python program using a `while` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but exits the
loop early if the number is greater than 5.
2. **For Loop**:
Write a Python program that uses a `for` loop to iterate over the string "CIS103" and prints
each character along with its ASCII value.
3. **Nested Loop**:
Write a program to generate the following pattern using nested loops:
```
*
**
***
****
```
4. **String Operations**:
- Write a Python function that takes a string and returns it reversed using slicing.
- Write a Python function that formats the following output for given variables:
```
Name: John, Age: 30, Salary: $50000.50
```
Use appropriate field widths to align the output.
5. **List Operations**:
- Create a list of integers. Write Python code to:
- Append a number to the list.
- Insert a number at a specific index.
- Sort the list in ascending order.
- Pop the last element of the list and print it.
- Remove a specific number from the list.
6. **Tuples**:
Write a Python program that creates a tuple with 5 elements and prints the first and last
elements. Then, attempt to modify one of the elements and explain the result.
7. **Dictionary Operations**:
- Create a dictionary with the following key-value pairs: `{'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city':
'New York'}`.
- Write Python code to:
- Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary.
- Update the value of the `age` key.
- Remove the `city` key from the dictionary.
- Print all the keys and values in the dictionary.
8. **Break and Continue**:
Write a Python program that uses a `while` loop and breaks out of the loop when a certain
condition is met. Include an option to `continue`, skipping an iteration.
